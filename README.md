## Welcome to My Github Repo
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

You can access the live website from dhilipkmr.github.io/materializedResume/
This is a Responsive Resume website based on material design created from the scratch.
Implemented using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, AngularJS(only for iterations and for rendering content in html) and Bootstrap(for Responsiveness)

## USAGE:
1.Clone the repo.

2.Install dependencies using "npm install" from the root of the Respository.

3.Start the local server by running run.bat Batch file located in the root of the Respository.
